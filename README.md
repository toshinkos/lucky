an expansion on us.

our name is hero! you may call us either that or whatevers in our nickname at the moment. we're a fictive heavy system, along with being alterhuman & fictionkin. feel free to strike up a conversation, we love talking to people! if we dont answer we're probably distracted offtab or afk, in which case feel free to whisper instead. ALSO ALSO!! we adore any type of interaction. feel free to cud, boop, whatever. we mainly hang out in the hoyoverse section of ponytown or the library or the bakery.  we tend to be in genshin related skins and have songs as nicknames. ah...also please dont interact with us for the sole reason of shipping? you know? while we're all for bennefischl or rannett or whatever, we'd prefer if you didn't. 

common fronters you may see around are...any number of our bennetts, and rowley. feel free to ask. we might not tell you. 

we're the (albeit self proclaimed) no1 bennett fan. dni if u think u like him more than us /j.
